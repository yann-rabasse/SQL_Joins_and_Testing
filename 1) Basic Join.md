The objective of this exercise is to learn basic SQL join operations by combining tables from a product catalog.

The green_catalog dataset consists of several product-related tables:

- green_product: Base table representing the product catalog
- green_pdt_segment: Provides the segment of each product
- green_promo: Information about promotions
- green_price: Information about product prices
- green_stock: Information about product stock
- green_categories: Information about product categories
- green_sales: Information about the quantity of products sold in the last 3 months

## 1) Join Queries - Building Joins


1) Join the green_product and green_pdt_segment tables to return the pdt_name and pdt_segment columns. Choose an INNER JOIN based on the schema and analysis goals. Specify the column (i.e.products_id) to join ON.
```
SELECT
  p.pdt_name
  ,sgt.pdt_segment
FROM `green_catalog.green_product` AS p
INNER JOIN `green_catalog.green_pdt_segment` AS sgt ON p.products_id = sgt.products_id
```


2) Add stock information to the main product details by joining the green_product and green_stock tables. Use alias names for each table so that the SELECT clause can unambiguously identify which table a specific column comes from.
```
SELECT
  -- product table --
  p.products_id
  ,p.pdt_name
  ,p.products_status
  ,p.categories_id
  ,p.promo_id
  -- stock table
  ,st.stock
  ,st.stock_forecast
FROM `green_catalog.green_product` AS p
INNER JOIN `green_catalog.green_stock` AS st ON p.products_id = st.pdt_id
```


3) SELECT products_id, pdt_name, promo_name, and promo_pourcent from the green_product and green_promo tables. Ensure the result includes product rows without a promotion. Experiment with different JOIN types to return all products, both with and without promotions.
```
SELECT
  -- product table --
  p.products_id
  ,p.pdt_name
  -- promo table
  ,pr.promo_name
  ,pr.promo_pourcent
FROM `green_catalog.green_product` AS p
LEFT JOIN `green_catalog.green_promo` AS pr ON p.promo_id = pr.promo_id
```


4) Add price information from green_price to green_product.
```
SELECT
  -- product table --
  p.products_id
  ,p.pdt_name
  ,p.products_status
  ,p.categories_id
  ,p.promo_id
  -- price table
  ,pr.pd_cat
  ,pr.ps_cat
FROM `green_catalog.green_product` AS p
INNER JOIN `green_catalog.green_price` AS pr USING (products_id)
```


5) Return the products_id and pdt_name with all their associated category information.
```
SELECT
  -- product table --
  p.products_id
  ,p.pdt_name
  ,p.categories_id
  -- price table
  ,c.category_1
  ,c.category_2
  ,c.category_3
FROM `green_catalog.green_product` AS p
INNER JOIN `green_catalog.green_categories` AS c USING (categories_id)
```


6) Return the products_id, pdt_name, and their qty sold in the last 3 months. Include all products from green_product, even if they were not sold in the last 3 months. (Remember, the green_sales table only contains sales data from the past 3 months.)
```
SELECT
  -- product table --
  p.products_id
  ,p.pdt_name
  -- price table
  ,IFNULL(s.qty,0) AS qty
FROM `green_catalog.green_product` AS p
LEFT JOIN `green_catalog.green_sales` AS s ON p.products_id = s.pdt_id
```
- Use the left join to avoid losing products that have not been sold in the last 3 months.
- If there are no rows in green_sales, it means that the sales are equal to 0 over the last 3 months. We use the IFNULL function to assign 0 to the qty column instead of NULL.

7) Return the same result by using RIGHT JOIN.
```
SELECT
  -- product table --
  p.products_id
  ,p.pdt_name
  -- price table
  ,s.qty
FROM `green_catalog.green_sales` AS s
RIGHT JOIN `green_catalog.green_product` AS p ON p.products_id = s.pdt_id
```
